/*
 * TMUX INTEGRATION
 * =================
 *
 * Small helper for integrating hed with tmux. It manages a dedicated
 * "runner" pane and provides helpers to open/toggle it and send
 * commands to it.
 *
 * High‑level behavior:
 * - Detects whether we are running inside tmux (via $TMUX)
 * - Creates a new pane (vertical split) for running commands
 * - Remembers the created pane's ID and can toggle (show/hide) it
 * - Sends arbitrary command lines to the pane via tmux send-keys
 *
 * These helpers are wired to editor commands and keybindings so that
 * you can do things like:
 *   :tmux_toggle           -> toggle the runner pane
 *   :tmux_send echo hi     -> send "echo hi" + Enter to the runner pane
 *   <space>ts              -> send current line to the runner pane
